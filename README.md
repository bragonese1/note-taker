# Note-Taker

## Project Title
Note-Taker 

## Description
My note taker application allows a user to write, save and delete notes. This provides the oppurtunity to be extremely organized. When you reach the site, you will come across a landing page asking you to get started. From there you are one click away from starting your note taking adventure.

## Installation
`` The following steps need to be performed in the command line if this repo is forked. You will need to run in bash "npm i" to install packages, npm uuid, and then npm start.

```
npm i
npm uuid
npm start
```

## Usage
The first step is to click get started. After that you can insert a title for your note, the actual note itself, and then press save. From there you can see your notes on the left side where you can delete them if you want. Also, while typing a note you can clear the form and start from scratch. This allows you to create notes and then delete them once you have no need for the note.
